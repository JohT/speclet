//README file for "wave++/source" directory. January 25, 2000.

1) This directory ("wave++/source") contains all the source files that
are necessary to build the wave++ library. To do this just type the command

make

this will create the archive file (libw.a) that you will need 
to link against when using wave++ in your programs. You will 
also need to include libw.h in your applications. To see an 
example of how this can be acomplished see the directory "wave++/demos".
