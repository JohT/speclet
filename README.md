## This is not working yet

This version is not ready yet. 
It contains the code from back then, that doesn't compile any more.   
It also contains the plugin made with the tutorial [Learn Modern C++ by Building an Audio Plugin (w/ JUCE Framework) - Full Course YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc&list=PLi4rQ_T_X31Gd4pyUbvPltTVSyw8v_yYT&index=5&t=1051s)
as a template to start the modernization.
